My program is to show a charity event.
The theme is that children in kindergarten take out their own handmade items or take out their favorite toys, and sell them at the market to raise funds. These funds will be donated to help children with financial difficulties, such as helping them buy food, books or daily necessities, etc. 
The purpose of this activity is to let these children know how to cherish the resources that have been used now and try to help them. And through this program, we can appeal to the general public to help people in difficult lives.
